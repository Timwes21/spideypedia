## Description

A Web Application for managing your comics! Add or remove from your collection with the help of AI. I used to track my comics in a word document because i just wanted the simplicity to know what issue number i have and what grade. But it was difficult to manage and now I keep buying duplicates! So I made something that would help me and hopefully others.

## Features

- A table where you comics are stored
- A chatbot assistant to automate updating and checking your collection
- Uses Redis, Websockets, and Mongodb to keep the comic collection up to date!
