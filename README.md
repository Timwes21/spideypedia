# Description
A Web Application for managing your comics! I felt most applications were bloated with microservices and offered little flexibility, so I made one.

# Why?
I used to track my comics in a word document because i just wanted the simplicity to know what issue number i have and what grade. But it was difficult to manage and now I keep buying duplicates! So I made something that would help me and hopefully others.

# Future Plans
I am going to hopefully have a working mobile app by the end of the year, that can add to you collection based on a picture.
